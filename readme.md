🚀 Conversational Voice AI Agent with LiveKit<br>  
This project is a real-time Conversational Voice AI Agent built using LiveKit Agents, integrating speech-to-text (STT), a large language model (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS) to enable fully automated two-way voice conversations.

✅ Key features:-

-Real-time streaming voice conversations.<br>
-STT powered by Groq Whisper-Large-v3.<br>
-LLM responses generated by Groq Llama 3.<br>
-TTS output via ElevenLabs voices.<br>
-Multilingual turn detection & noise cancellation.<br>
-Built with LiveKit Agents Python SDK.<br>

🗂️ Project structure

```bash

voice_ai_agent/
 ├── .env
 ├── requirements.txt
 ├── agent.py   # This file
 ├── README.md

```

⚙️ Requirements:-

-Python 3.9+<br>
-LiveKit Cloud account & API keys<br>
-Groq API keys for STT/LLM<br>
-ElevenLabs API key & voice ID<br>

📥 Installation:-

1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karthikeyareddy183/conversational_AI_Agent.git
cd voice-ai-agent
```

2. Create & activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download model files:-

To use the turn-detector, silero, or noise-cancellation plugins, you first need to download the model files:

```bash
python agent.py download-files
```

4. 🔑 Environment variables
   Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# LiveKit Cloud credentials
LIVEKIT_URL=your_livekit_url_here
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_KEY
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=YOUR_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET

# Groq API key
GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY

# ElevenLabs API key
ELEVEN_API_KEY=YOUR_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
```

🚀 How to run:-

1. Speak to your agent
   Start your agent in console mode to run inside your terminal:

```bash
python agent.py console
```

2. Follow the <a href="https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  LiveKit Voice AI Agents to:
</a>
 docs to:

-Set up a LiveKit Room<br>
-Generate an access token for your agent<br>
-Connect from a client (e.g., LiveKit’s VoiceBot demo or your custom client)<br>

📚 How it works:-

-AgentSession ties together:

    .STT → transcribes user input using Groq Whisper
    .LLM → generates context-aware replies with Groq Llama 3
    .TTS → converts text replies to natural speech with ElevenLabs

-turn_detection & noise_cancellation improve voice interaction quality.<br>
-Everything runs as an Agent Worker that joins your LiveKit Room.<br>

💡 Tips<br>
✅ Make sure your .env has valid keys.<br>
✅ Use requirements.txt to keep dependencies version-pinned.<br>
✅ Test your agent with a LiveKit sample app or the VoiceBot demo.<br>
